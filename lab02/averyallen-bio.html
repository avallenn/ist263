    I am Avery Allen and I am studying Applied Data Analytics at the School of Information Studies with a Public Communication Studies Minor at Newhouse. For my future career I want to demonstrate my technical skills with innovative communication strategies to make data clear, interesting, and actionable. Some of the skills include knowledge in SQL, VS Code, Adobe Photoshop and Premiere, and Python coding Language. On a personal note, outside of class I am a part of the sorority Delta Gamma, on the club field hockey team, and enjoy spending time with my friends where we watch comedy movies and have game nights.
