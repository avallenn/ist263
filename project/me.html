            <h2>My Personal Testimony</h2>
            <h3>My Experience with Adopting</h3>
            <p>Throughout the course of my life, I have always had a dog that we adopted. It is something that my dad has been very passionate about and it has shaped how I view my relationship with animals. I have been taught that they are family and should be treated like that. This is why adopting and not shopping for pets is such an important topic for me. Without my family adopting my dogs I do not know what would have happened to them.</p>

                <div class="chancetxt">
                    <p>Chance was the calmest yellow lab you would have ever met. He was adopted by my parents a month before I was born. His original owner abandoned him by tying him to a tree in the woods. He was then found in the woods and taken to a shelter, where my dad fell in love with him. <br>
                    Growing up with a dog by my side was so beneficial. I learned how to be gentle and affectionate and how to have responsibilities taking care of him. We played together, but he was also there for me when I was sad, easing my little, immature tantrums.

                <p>Two weeks after Chance passed away, we got Opal, and this dog completely changed my life.<br>
                Houston has one of the worse dog overpopulation issues because there are so many street dogs that are not spayed or neutered, and Opal was one of them. At only a year old she got pregnant, but luckily a truck driver who takes in stray dogs saw her and took her in. She then got taken into the shelter in which she was overlooked because people only wanted puppies, not a two-year-old dog that had already birthed puppies. However, when we saw Opal online we knew we had to meet her. <br>
                We met at a Bass Pro Shop and from the start I knew she would be the most perfect job. The family that was fostering her had a young child and Opal would not keep her eye off her, which made me immediately realize how loyal she was.<br>
                Opal was my rock throughout the hardest moments of my life. She was with me during COVID when I felt the most alone. She would cuddle with me at night, play around with me, and always be by my side. She got very sick when I was at school, but she waited until I came home for Thanksgiving for me to say goodbye, showing me how much she truly loved me.

                <h2>Mae</h2>
                <div class="maetxt">
                    <p>Mae is the newest addition to my family. We got her at the end of my senior year so I will always associate her with a new chapter of my life. We got her when she was two months old, so this contradicts the common misconception that you can only purchase puppies from puppy mills.<br> 
                    Mae was born in Tennessee in a foster home. She had a bunch of other siblings, and her silly personality made us love her. We got her when Opal was still around, and they instantly became best friends. Opal taught her how to be a good, loving girl and I cannot wait to see how she develops out of her puppy stage.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Without the shelters that I adopted Chance, Opal, and Mae from, they would have been abandoned. I hope that my testimony shows you the wonderful opportunities and experiences that shelters provide. I want to preface that these experiences happened without having a “designer”, expensive dog, our dogs have all had amazing health, and they all never had behavior issues. I hope that if you are considering getting a pet, think about my experiences and decide to <strong>adopt and not shop.</strong></p>
