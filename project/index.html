            <h2>Consider Adopting a Pet</h2>
            <p>When considering purchasing a pet, you should adopt because it not only benefits the animal, but also you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You are saving a life. </strong>Many animals that are in shelters have been given up, abandoned, or lost. They are helpless and unwanted, needing a second chance of life. You can provide them with this life in a loving and safe home. </li>
                <li><strong>Combating pet overpopulation. </strong>Each year 8 to 12 million dogs and cats are euthanized because there are not enough homes for them. Adopting from a shelter helps reduce the overpopulation cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Adopting an adult animal. </strong>Not all the animals in shelters are adults, but there are some and they come with great advantages. Being already grown you can see their personalities; you already know what you get. Many of them are also housetrained and can understand commands such as “sit” and “high-five”.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting charity and the community. </strong>When adopting a pet from a shelter, you are supporting a non-profit organization. This is beneficial because shelters mandate that adopted animals be spayed or neutered, reducing the chances of unwanted animals.</li>
                <li><strong>You are paying less. </strong>Purebred puppies or kittens are sold for profit, but adoption shelters do not do this, they have low adoption fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Spreading awareness. </strong>Your adoption can encourage others to do the same when meeting your wonderful pet <a href='https://www.hhhstopeka.org/adopt/top-10-reasons-to-adopt-from-an-animal-shelter/'><sup>1</sup></a>.</li>
