            <h2>Consider Adopting a Pet</h2>
            <p>When considering purchasing a pet, you should adopt because it not only benefits the animal, but also you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You are saving a life.</strong> Many animals in shelters have been abandoned, lost, or given up. They are helpless and in need of a second chance. You can give them that chance by providing a loving and safe home.</li>
                <li><strong>Combating pet overpopulation.</strong> Each year, 8 to 12 million dogs and cats are euthanized due to a lack of available homes. Adopting from a shelter helps reduce this overpopulation crisis.</li>
                <li><strong>Adopting an adult animal.</strong> While not all shelter animals are adults, many are—and they offer great advantages. With adult pets, their personalities are already developed, so you know what to expect. Many are also house-trained and understand basic commands like “sit” and “high-five.”</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting charities and your community.</strong> By adopting from a shelter, you support a nonprofit organization. Most shelters require adopted animals to be spayed or neutered, which helps reduce the number of unwanted animals.</li>
                <li><strong>You are paying less.</strong> Purebred puppies and kittens sold for profit often come with a hefty price tag. In contrast, adoption fees at shelters are much lower and support a good cause.</li>
                <li><strong>Spreading awareness.</strong> Your adoption story can inspire others to consider adopting when they see your amazing pet <a href="https://www.hhhstopeka.org/adopt/top-10-reasons-to-adopt-from-an-animal-shelter/"><sup>1</sup></a>.</li>
